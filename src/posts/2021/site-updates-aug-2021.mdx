title: "August 2021 site updates: Ditching Tailwind.css and embracing MDX"

I recently did a little refactor of this site where I removed Tailwind CSS and switch my post formatting to MDX.

## Bye Tailwind

I added Tailwind back [February 2021](https://github.com/jamesrwilliams/personal-site/pull/35) in an attempt make my site easier to maintain. In theory this was a great move. I found it to significantly slow down my builds, increase development time and bloat my markup with its classes. I think this site has a pretty simple design, so maybe it's just overkill.

## Hello MDX

The majority of content on this site lives as Markdown, I've recently switched this site to use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) instead which opens my editing experience up to being able to use other JSX components right in the posts. I had a brief introduction to MDX when working with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) building component docs but the fact you can quickly add components to posts very cool. Not using it much yet but the option is there, probably good to image and layout controls.
