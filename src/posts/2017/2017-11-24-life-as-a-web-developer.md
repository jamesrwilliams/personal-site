Towards the end of 2017 I was asked by the recruitment agency [Adlib][1] (who helped me land my job at Silver) to write an article as part of their &#8220;live as a&#8221; series. Every few weeks they publish a new article about positions they&#8217;ve been involved with placing, detailing what their day to day work entails. Heres a little preview of what we talk about:

- In plain English, what do I do?
  - In a nutshell, what has been my career journey so far?
  - What do you like most about your job?
  - What are 3 key things you consider when choosing an employer?
  - What 3 top tips would you give someone to ensure that their skills and knowledge as a Web Developer remain top notch?</ul>
