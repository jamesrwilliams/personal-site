For our second camping trip of 2020 we headed further north to <a href="http://www.ontarioparks.com/park/grundylake">Grundy Lake Provincial Park</a>. A pleasant three-hour drive out of Toronto, towards Perry Sound in north(ish) Ontario.

The weather held up as we arrived on Friday afternoon and set up camp. One of the main attractions at Grundy Lake Park are the cliff jumping and "rock sliding" spots. Grundy Lake has some unique rocks that are perfectly angled for a short run and slide into the lake. Think running on your socks on a wood floor, but instead of socks, you've got mossy rocks, and instead of a wood floor, it is a lake. This was my first lake swimming experience, certainly harder to get out that you would imagine. 

A short walk to south, on the edge of Gut Lake, there are some perfect rock formations for cliff-jumping. They range in height from small drops all the way to the tallest being around 7.5 m above the lake! I almost lost my watch jumping off that one!

Saturday was super rainy, so we spent the day floating around in Grundy Lake. Luckily for us, the weather cleared up on Sunday, and we headed-out to hike the nearby 1.9 km Swan Lake Trail.

On the way home we took a detour into the Muskoka Lakes Farm and Winery, the first commercial cranberry farm Ontario! They also have the funnest URL in Canada I feel: https://cranberry.ca. We picked up some cranberry spritzers, some local pop and headed on home. Below you can see the [Head Tour Guide](https://cranberry.ca/our-team/), Trooper having a snoozal by the office.
