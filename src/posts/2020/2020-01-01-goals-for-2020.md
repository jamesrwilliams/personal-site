**2019 was a very good year for me**. I went on two very exciting trips, one to Disney World, and later to Banff National Park, which was a lovely close to my first full year in Canada. On the professional front I got a fantastic job with the lovely people at [Points](https://points.com) and I have learned a lot of Angular and Node.

To kick off 2020 I wanted to note down a few goals for myself this year. I did a similar thing a few years back and never stuck to it, so we're doing this again. In 2020 I aim to do the following:

1. **Complete a weekly personal development challenge**: Completing something like a [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/jamesrwilliams) challenge or a comprehensive CodePen test write up. Something, whatever it is each week, to force myself to keep learning.
1. **Read 6 books**: I've never been a big reader, this year I want that to change a bit. The first one on my list is: "[The Imagineering Process: Using the Disney Theme Park Design Process to Bring Your Creative Ideas to Life](https://amzn.to/2MJwu0x)" which I received for Christmas.
1. **Publish a project**: I've worked on a lot of side things that are all in various stages of being finished. This year I'd like to finish one. Basic as it might be, I'd like to get it online and being used.
