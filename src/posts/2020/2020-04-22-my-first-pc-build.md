With COVID-19 cancelling all my travel plans for the year, and finding myself with a lot more time on my hands I decided it was time to retire my old 2009 27" iMac.

I had already moved all my side project work onto my new Points work laptop (a 13-inch, 2018 MacBook Pro) so the reasons to keep the iMac were getting smaller and smaller. Epically when my new MacBook can out preform my iMac!

After a few years of attempting to game on it using Mac OSX Boot Camp it was time I joined the big leagues and built myself my own gaming PC. A perfect way to spend my first bonus from Points!

## Parts

With the help of some colleagues at Points and lots of searching on PCPartPicker I settled on the following part list here are the specs for my first gaming PC:

| Components    |                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| CPU           | AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (Overclocked to 4.10GHz) |
| GPU           | Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER 6 GB      |
| Memory        | 2x G.SKill Ripjaws 16GB v16 (3600mhz)     |
| PSU           | Cooler Master MWE Gold 750 W 80+          |
| Motherboard   | MSI B450 Tomahawk Max                     |
| Case          | Corsair Carbide 175R RGB                  |
| Storage (SSD) | Patriot VPN100 512GB NVME SSD             |
| Storage (HDD) | Seagate Barracuda Compute 2TB             |

| Peripherals |                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Monitor     | LG 34" UltraWide Monitor (34UM69G-B) |
| Keyboard    | Razer Cynosa Chroma                  |
| Mouse       | Razer Deathadder Essential           | 
| Dock        | Dell 6000 USB-C Dock                 |

_The dock is super handy for connecting my MacBook to my monitor and for charging without a myriad of cables. It also mirrors my setup almost at the Points office which is convenient._

## The Build

I installed the stock CPU fan with the top AMD logo to the right initially. I only noticed after trying to install my second RAM kit. So while installing the new RAM I took the time to rotate the fan 90deg to keep the AMD logo chunk at the top. Looking quite tidy now I think:

## Benchmarks

I ran 3DMark's benchmarks initially a week or so after building just before deciding to order a second RAM kit hence the before/after RAM kit upgrades, no surprise that the 32gb was a bit better.

## Next Upgrades

Probably not wise that I'm overclocking with a stock CPU cooler, I'll be looking into an after market one soon. I've been looking at some all-in-one liquid coolers, but these might be a little overkill for my current setup and usage. One thing I am certainly going to buy soon is another SSD for games. My poor M.2 boot drive is under way too much usage with Steam games at the moment.
