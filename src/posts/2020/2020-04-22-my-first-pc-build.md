Just before all this COVID-19 imposed lifestyle choices, and after talking about it for so long, I decided it was time to retire my 2009 27" iMac and change up my computer setup. I use my work laptop (13-inch, 2018 MacBook Pro) for, well work, and any side projects, but gaming on a Mac is not a thing.

So with the help of some friends on the part list here are the specs for my first gaming PC:

## Benchmarks

I ran 3DMark's benchmarks initially a week or so after building, In the meantime I've ordered another 16 GB ram kit so here is the breakdown for the before and after.

## Next Upgrades

Probably not wise that I'm overclocking with a stock CPU cooler, I'll be looking into an after market one soon. I've been looking at some all-in-one liquid coolers, but these might be a little overkill for my current setup and usage. 

Probably another SSD for steam games as my poor M.2 boot drive is under way too much usage with Steam games at the moment.
