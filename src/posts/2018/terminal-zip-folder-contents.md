ZIP the contents of the current folder into a zip with it&#8217;s parent directory as it&#8217;s name. Useful for zipping just the contents without the folder parent folder.

```bash
zip -r "${PWD##*/}".zip .
```

Zip the current directory into a folder called `app.zip`:

```bash
zip -r app.zip .
```

Especially useful for proprietary email clients, I'm looking at you Dell EMC, and certain manifest files.
