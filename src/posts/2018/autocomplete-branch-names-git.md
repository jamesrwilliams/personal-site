Trying to get over the force of habit that is using tab to auto-complete things on Mac. Well, it does'nt work for git out of the box but here is a way to get it working on the command line. You can use this script as part of your `bash_profile` in order to be able to auto-complete long branch names by pressing `tab`.

First, download the script to your home folder:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash
```

Next, you need to edit your `~/.bash_profile` and add the following:

```
if [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then
  . ~/.git-completion.bash
fi
```
