The very talented people over at [Spatie][1] have a cool way to pay them back for their open source work. Postcards.

I recently came across this while looking for a library to create those pesky &#8220;Add to calendar&#8221; links (a technology that still hasn&#8217;t been standardised with schema).

All they ask for in return for using their libraries is that you send them &#8220;_a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using_&#8220;. They have a page showcasing the postcards they&#8217;ve received on their website which is a nice touch too.
