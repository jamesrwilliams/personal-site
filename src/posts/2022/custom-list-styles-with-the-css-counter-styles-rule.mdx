You want emojis for your list markers? Well you got it with the `@counter-style` at-rule. On the
surface it can be could be seen as a general expansion on the
[`list-style-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style) CSS property but
it is so much more! While seemingly powerful, sadly it isn't ready for production systems just,
yet it is in Editor's draft status with the W3C spec but no Safari support.

**FYI - If you're using an iOS device or Safari - the examples below will probably not
work as these features are not yet currently supported in either**

At-rules are CSS statements that tells CSS how to behave, and this is just one of many you
probably have heard of joining the likes of `@media`, `@font-face`, `@keyframes` and the many
others. Here is a basic `@counter-style` rule that sets up an emoji fruit list element:

```css{numberLines: 1}
@counter-style fruit {
  system: fixed;
  symbols: "üçé" "üçä" "üçê";
  suffix: " ";
}

#fruit { list-style: fruit; }
```

You can see on line 3 above we're providing a list of strings that will act as our list symbols:

<ul id={"fruit"}>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Pear</li>
</ul>

If you don't see it you're probably on an iOS device or using Safari. If not, note how we only
have 3 options, what happens if we have a list that is longer? That is where the system comes
into play, the above example used `fixed`, this says that we have a finite set of symbols and
once they are exhausted, fallback to a default value, like so:

<ul id={"fruit"}>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Pear</li>
  <li>Pineapple?</li>
</ul>

We can opt to use the `system: cyclic` property as well, our list will cycle through the values once
it's reached the end. The astute amongst you might also notice we're using the `suffix`
property here to add an extra space character as a spacer.

<ul id={"fruit-cycle"}>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Pear</li>
  <li>Pineapple</li>
  <li>Grape</li>
  <li>Ancient Fruit</li>
</ul>

### Padding numbers with leading zeros

Now the possibilities with this rule are vast. The first example use case that came to mind was a
leading zero list. We can do this by using the `decimal` system and then extends it by adding
padding.

```css
@counter-style padded {
  system: extends decimal;
  pad: 2 "0";
}
```

Which then would show the following:

<ol id={"padded"}>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ol>

This `pad` descriptor, is made up of two values. the first is the minimum length the marker
should reach, in this example we want a minimum length of 2 characters. If the minimum is not
met the value is padded with the second value, here a string "0". Now, you could do this with a
pseudo-element like
this [example Codepen](https://codepen.io/maddesigns/pen/JGQejg) but this actually hides the list
marker and replaces it with the pseudo-element.

There are a lot more properties and even more combinations properties you can specify
here. One important one of note is the `speak-as` property, this instructs screen-readers how the
value should be spoken. You can specify this as a word, number or as something like `numbers`.

```css
@counter-style fruit {
  system: fixed;
  symbols: "üçé" "üçä" "üçê";
  suffix: " ";
  speak-as: numbers;
}
```

For the many other options, such as `negative` that specifies symbols when the counter value is
infinitive, or `range` that allows you to define symbols for a range of values. For the
many others I will leave the descriptions and explanation to the better technical writers of MDN:
