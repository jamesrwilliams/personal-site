              Hello! I&apos;m James W. A development engineer, originally from the UK but who moved
              to Canada in 2018. I am currently working with both JavaScript (TypeScript, React.js,
              Node, Gatsby, and Ionic) and Python (Flask, Django etc).
            </p>
            <p>
              I first started with web development in 2011 as part of a college project and never
              dropped it. I then changed my plans for my undergraduate degree from marketing to
              &quot;Multimedia Web Design&quot; at the University of Gloucestershire. My
              professional start was in a few agencies developing bespoke WordPress themes amongst
              other things like natural language processing powered chat bots, and interactive
              direct-marketing campaigns. Now I&apos;m building the future of loyalty
              at <Link to="https://www.points.com">Points.com</Link>.

            <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

              I&apos;ve been a professional developer for { activeYears } years, working in a
              variety of environments including non-profits, creative agencies, and product
              development settings. Working on a diverse range of web based projects both for B2B
              and consumer facing audiences. My professional journey so far:

            <h2>Things I use</h2>

            <p>
              I use <Link to="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate</Link> as my
              project <abbr title="Integrated development environment">IDE</abbr> and a little bit
              of <Link to="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</Link> for other random files.
              In both I use <Link to="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">FiraCode</Link> (with ligatures) as
              my code typeface of choice, and on the command line I use <Link to="https://iterm2.com">iTerm2</Link> running

            <p>
              For work I use a Macbook Pro (13-inch 2018) plugged into a LG 34â€³ UltraWide Monitor
              (34UM69G-B) using a Dell 3000 USB-C dock, and a wireless Apple mouse and keyboard.
              When I need my headphones I&apos;ve got a set of Bose QC 35s. For fun I&apos;ve got a
              self-built gaming PC, specs for which are outlined in this
              post: <Link to="/posts/pc-building-part-1">Building my own PC</Link>.

            <h2>This site</h2>

            <p>
              This site statically rendered with GatsbyJS, using MDX for posts and styled-components
              to handle the design. All deployed via Netlify from its home
              on <Link to={siteRepoLink}>GitHub</Link>. It is a full progressive web app that uses
              Algolia for my search service. This is the successor for my old .co.uk domain
              now I am based in Canada!
