              Hello! I&apos;m James W. a development engineer, originally from the UK but moved to
              Canada in 2018. I am currently working with both JavaScript (TypeScript, React.js,
              Node, Gatsby, and Ionic) and Python (Flask, Django etc).
            </p>
            <p>
              I first started with web development in 2011 as part of a college project and never
              dropped it. I then changed my plans for my undergraduate degree from marketing to
              &quot;Multimedia Web Design&quot; at the University of Gloucestershire. My
              professional start was in a few agencies developing bespoke WordPress themes amongst
              other things like AI powered Chat Bots, and interactive direct-marketing campaigns.
              Now I&apos;m building the future of loyalty at <El href="https://www.points.com">Points.com</El>.
            </p>

            <h2>Things I use</h2>

            <p>
              I use <El href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate</El> for major
              projects and a little bit of <El href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</El>
              for other random, non-project files. In both I use
              <El href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">FiraCode</El> (with ligatures) as my code
              typeface of choice, and on the command line I use
              <El href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm2</El> running with
              <El href="https://ohmyz.sh/">ohmyz</El>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building things and surfing in general with the help of
              <El href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</El>
            </p>

            <h3>Gear</h3>

            <p>
              For work I use a Macbook Pro (13-inch 2018) plugged into a LG 34â€³ UltraWide Monitor
              (34UM69G-B) using a Dell 3000 USB-C dock. A wireless Apple mouse and keyboard. When I
              need my headphones I&apos;ve got a set of Bose QC 35s. For fun I&apos;ve got a
              self-built gaming PC, specs for which are outlined in this post here
              &quot;<Link to="/posts/my-first-pc-build">Building my own PC</Link>&quot;.
            </p>

            <h2>This site</h2>

            <p>
              This site is built with GatsbyJS using MDX for posts and styled-components to handle
              the design. All deployed via Netlify from its home
              on <El href={siteRepoLink}>jamesrwilliams/personal-site</El>, and is a full
              progressive web app! Using Algolia for my search service. This is the natural
              replacement for my jamesrwilliams.co.uk domain now I am based in Canada!
