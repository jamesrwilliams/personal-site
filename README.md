This is the source code for my personal website. Built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), 
deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I'm a development engineer based in Canada, 
who enjoys building delightfully fast, easy to use, and engaging digital projects. I'm working with 
the wonderful team at [Points](https://points.com), building the future of loyalty.

remember to install and pull down images before trying to run a fresh build. You can do this with:

```bash
git lfs fetch
```
